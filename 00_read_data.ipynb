I agree that swingers are not for me, neither would be polyamory.

      "This is going to be a really weird mentality for people to grasp, but let me put it this way. If bacteria from a third party is transmitted to me sexually, that feels like a violation.

If I'm having sex with one person however and they're having different partners regularly, from a viral/bacterial standpoint that's no different than being involved in an orgy even though I never agreed to that.\n",

      "Your own personal reasons may be different, and I know that swingers go to a lot of effort to keep themselves and their partners safe.

We still do it though, because it's culture and part of good manners, and get sick as a result. \n",
      "\n",
      "How this applies to sex and swinging is that you may have every intention of keeping yourself and others safe, you may get tested regularly and use protection during sex, even including things like dental dams.

      "I'm sure that will offend many swingers who are super safe and would never put others in danger, but that is my personal reason for avoiding it. I can masturbate all I want to orgy porn, but frankly the idea of actually having sex with a bunch of different people disgusts me on an intellectual level. I would far rather have a whole bunch of people in a room masturbating together and not touching than actually having sex. It doesn't matter how careful people are, to err is human and mistakes will happen. That's why despite having a high sex drive beyond what any partner has ever been able to match, I stay monogamous and just use masturbation to take care of the extra urges.\n",

      "My primary surgeon destroyed my nose. I went to David Hacker (Toronto Rhinoplasty Clinic) and my nose was ruined. I couldn't breathe at all and it was collapsing. He left me with various issues (Inverted-v, alar collapse, etc). He was the most miserable and horrible man I ever met. I can't believe he's a doctor, but it seems that many others have posted and left reviews of their poor experiences with him...so I can hope others can avoid being botched by him. That year was horrible and all I could do was research and go to consultations with other surgeons to find a way to fix this mess.\n",
      "I would not recommend going to Oakley Smith. I ended up going to him (Oakley Smith) and he seemed good. But he's really just a salesman and he sold me on having him do my surgery...choosing him was mistake #2 I made. He fixed some issues (inverted-v poorly..., flared nostrils) and worsened other issues + created new ones (alar collapse worsened, pinched tip and crooked nose). He gave multiple excuses for the issues he left me with and then tried to convince me it was in my head or well my airways were \"open/not blocked\" so I should be able to breathe well (I can literally see my alar cartilage that has sunken in and blocked my airway + it sticks to my septum). I ended up getting several second opinions to confirm this. So I have a revision surgeon that will be fixing the issues oakley smith left me with (thicker spreader graft, alar strut grafts, tip repositioning).\n",
      "At my one year appointment he was more focused on my reviews/posts I left, kept asking why I was so angry (or was surprised at how frustrated/angry I was)...like do you think this is a joke? I paid you 18k to fix the function and look, you did a half-assed and lazy job. Idk he kept bringing these reviews/posts up and I realized then and there that he cares more about these posts/reviews than his patients. I'm sure they're keeping an eye on any other posts I make as well based on how he kept bringing these posts/reviews up...He decided to try lying to my face and state that perhaps I had taken him talking/thinking out loud as stating that x is the issue. And dude no, you did your poor checkup and then straight up said to my face the issue is x (then it was y the next time, then z, etc). But whatever, so I had stressed I prioritized function over the look since the start. And he had the gall to be shocked about how angry I am, like he should know how hard the recovery is for rhinoplasty (let alone a revision), taking time off work/school, etc. And he went off on how he is the best at what he does and basically the gist was he's the best at rhinoplasty? And went on to state that any surgeon that tells me they can fix this is lying and whatnot. He was triggered tbh and just was going on and on about how he's the best, etc.\n",
      "It was a bit amusing to hear tbh (like I was trying to keep my eyes from rolling to the back of my head...), because based on my experience + the experience of all these numerous people I have met that have poor results from smith (and ones who did a second revision with him to end off worse)...He's not the best and he shouldn't be telling these patients that no other doctor can fix the mess he made (especially if he's basing it off whether it can fixed on his own skill+experience...which again is lacking as they caused the issues in the first place). There's no reason to scare these patients off from going to get a second opinion or getting a revision elsewhere.\n",
      "Either way he gave out some random percentage success rate (like I predicted) and said he would do a revision. A few days later I received a message and basically he thinks I have good results + revision is not worth it and he'll discuss things further/options in the new year. So having a nose that does not function and is crooked is a good result for him. Take that as you will if anyone is considering him. Either way I have a revision surgeon that will be fixing the issues Oakley Smith left me with. There was honestly no way I would trust him to have the skill/ability or the ethics to do another revision. He would definitely leave me worse off and I don't trust him not to do something I already declined (i.e. he and his student kept trying to push me to do a turbinate reduction, knowing that the alar collapse + other issues are causing the breathing problems, and I said no numerous times and they kept pushing). You want a doctor that see patients as people and not just a profit. Funny thing is that, I have stated smith uses fake reviews and it seems that he had many of the negative ones he received removed (example: he had like 380 reviews on ratemd a while ago and now it's down to 360 or something with like all his negative reviews removed). So please be careful if you choose to go to him as he has them removed. If I could go back in time I would never touch my nose (or go to Hacker or Smith). I could live with a crooked nose that's the thing; it's the breathing issues that are the worst.\n",
